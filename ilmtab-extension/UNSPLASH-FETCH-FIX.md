# Unsplash Double-Fetch Fix

## Problem Identified

✅ **Fixed double-fetching issue** where Unsplash API was being called on both the 4th AND 5th images instead of just once per batch.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Problematic Logic

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: This triggered on BOTH 4th and 5th images
const shouldPrefetch = nextIndex >= imageCache.images.length - 2;

// When nextIndex = 3 (4th image): 3 >= 5-2 → 3 >= 3 → TRUE → Fetches ✅
// When nextIndex = 4 (5th image): 4 >= 5-2 → 4 >= 3 → TRUE → Fetches ❌ (DUPLICATE!)
```

### Expected Behavior (Your Understanding)

1. **Initial fetch**: Get 5 images (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
2. **Navigate**: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (no fetching)
3. **On 4th image**: Fetch new batch in background, replace images 1, 2, 3 with new ones
4. **Navigate to 5th**: No fetch needed (already have it)
5. **Continue**: 5 → new1 → new2 → new3 (no fetching)
6. **On new3**: Fetch again for next batch

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Logic

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Only triggers on second-to-last image (4th image in a 5-image batch)
const shouldPrefetch = nextIndex === imageCache.images.length - 2;

// When nextIndex = 3 (4th image): 3 === 5-2 → 3 === 3 → TRUE → Fetches ✅
// When nextIndex = 4 (5th image): 4 === 5-2 → 4 === 3 → FALSE → No fetch ✅
```

### Enhanced Logging

```javascript
if (shouldPrefetch && imageCache.images[0]?.id !== "fallback") {
  console.log(
    "🔄 Prefetching more images on second-to-last image (index:",
    nextIndex,
    ")"
  );
  // ... fetch logic
}
```

## Technical Details

### Batch Management Logic

- **Fetch trigger**: Only on `nextIndex === imageCache.images.length - 2`
- **Queue management**: Keep last 3 images, add 5 new ones
- **Index adjustment**: Properly handle transition from old batch to new batch
- **Fallback handling**: Skip prefetch for fallback images

### API Efficiency Improvements

- **50% reduction** in unnecessary API calls
- **Better rate limiting compliance** with Unsplash API
- **Improved performance** with fewer network requests
- **Cleaner console logs** for debugging

## Before vs After

### Before (Problematic)

```
Image 1 → Image 2 → Image 3 → Image 4 (FETCH) → Image 5 (FETCH AGAIN!) → ...
                                    ↑                    ↑
                                 Correct              Unnecessary!
```

### After (Fixed)

```
Image 1 → Image 2 → Image 3 → Image 4 (FETCH) → Image 5 (use existing) → ...
                                    ↑                    ↑
                                 Correct              Efficient!
```

## Testing Scenarios

✅ **Initial batch fetch** (1st image) - Works correctly  
✅ **Navigation through batch** (2nd, 3rd images) - No unnecessary fetches  
✅ **Prefetch trigger** (4th image) - Fetches new batch correctly  
✅ **Use existing image** (5th image) - No duplicate fetch  
✅ **New batch navigation** (new 1st, 2nd, 3rd) - Uses prefetched images  
✅ **Next prefetch cycle** (new 4th image) - Fetches correctly again

## Performance Impact

### API Call Reduction

- **Before**: 2 API calls per 5-image cycle (on images 4 and 5)
- **After**: 1 API call per 5-image cycle (only on image 4)
- **Improvement**: 50% reduction in API calls

### User Experience

- **Faster navigation** due to fewer network requests
- **Better rate limiting compliance** with Unsplash API
- **Reduced bandwidth usage** for users
- **More predictable behavior** for debugging

## Code Changes

### File Modified

- `client/src/hooks/useRotatingImageCache.js`

### Specific Change

```diff
- const shouldPrefetch = nextIndex >= imageCache.images.length - 2;
+ const shouldPrefetch = nextIndex === imageCache.images.length - 2;

- console.log('🔄 Prefetching more images...');
+ console.log('🔄 Prefetching more images on second-to-last image (index:', nextIndex, ')');
```
