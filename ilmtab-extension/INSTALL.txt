IlmTab Browser Extension - Installation Instructions
===================================================

IMPORTANT: Load THIS FOLDER (ilmtab-extension) as the extension!

PREREQUISITES:
1. Make sure the IlmTab server is running on http://localhost:4000
   (The extension needs the server to fetch Islamic content)

BROWSER SUPPORT:
✅ Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera (use manifest.json)
✅ Firefox (rename manifest-firefox.json to manifest.json)
❓ Safari (requires Xcode conversion)

INSTALLATION STEPS:

For Chrome/Edge/Brave/Opera:
1. Open your browser's extensions page:
   - Chrome: chrome://extensions/
   - Edge: edge://extensions/
   - Brave: brave://extensions/
   - Opera: opera://extensions/
2. Turn ON "Developer mode" (toggle in top right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select THIS FOLDER (ilmtab-extension) - the one containing this file
5. The extension will be installed and ready to use!

For Firefox:
1. Rename "manifest-firefox.json" to "manifest.json" (replace existing)
2. Open Firefox and go to about:debugging
3. Click "This Firefox"
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
5. Select the manifest.json file in this folder

TESTING:
1. Open a new tab in your browser
2. You should see the IlmTab interface instead of the default new tab page
3. The extension will automatically load Islamic content from the server

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you see CORS errors, make sure the server is running with the updated CORS configuration
- If content doesn't load, check that http://localhost:4000 is accessible
- For Firefox: Make sure you renamed manifest-firefox.json to manifest.json
- Make sure you select the folder that contains:
  * index.html
  * manifest.json (or manifest-firefox.json for Firefox)
  * assets/ folder
  * This INSTALL.txt file

Note: The server has been updated to allow browser extension origins, so CORS issues should be resolved.
